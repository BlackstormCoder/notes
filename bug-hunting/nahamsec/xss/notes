Cross Site Scripting
=====================

- XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitary client-side code on a victim's browser.

- XSS can be used for phishing, account takeovers, exfiltrating data and a lot more.
	- eg. If a bank is vulnerable to xss, you can transfer money from 1 account to another, do account take overs, and even more severe if executed on a browser having admin privileges to that site.

Note: Every xss is not always triggered due to JS. It can be triggered in Flash, Active X, vbscript, angular as well.

Impact:
	- Read / Modify / Delete pages content
	- Steal a user's cookie or session and a session takeover
	- Server malicious content like phishing.

- Therefore a reflective XSS could be anywhere around medium... And a stored XSS is rated High to Critical.


Reflected:
	- In this type of XSS the payload is usually passed in via a URL and is having the payload attached to one of the parameter.

Stored:
	- In this type of XSS the malicious code injected by the attacker is stored on the server side.

DOM XSS:
	- For this type of XSS an attacker must have good hold of javascript programming.
		- the javascript used in the page is not properly implemented... If an attacker is smart enough to find the logic flaw, he/she will be able find a way to pass in a malicious parameter, and then make that function execute as he wants.

Note: Just because HTML injection like <u>John</u> is possible, doesn't mean that there will be XSS, but in lot of cases there is a way to escalate to XSS.

Labs:
	- xss.nahamsec.training
	- xss2.nahamsec.training
	- xss3.nahamsec.training
	- xss4.nahamsec.training

Note:
	- Remember try escaping the HTML tags using "> or '> or any how... And then try injecting the real stuff.

	- Lab 4 demonstrated, escaping the variable using single or double quotes, and then putting in the javascript we want to execute. 
		- Also, it demonstrated escaping the filters using entities &lt;script&gt;
