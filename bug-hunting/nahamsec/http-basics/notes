HTTP Headers ask for the following data when requesting a web-page. Folllowing are few headers that are commonly seen:
	- What page to fetch (GET)
	- Which host to fetch that page from (Host: xyz)
	- What is the user-agent. Version/Info of the browser that is trying to access the webpage. (User-Agent)
	- What type of content to send/receive (Content-Type; SUPER IMPORTANT WHILE TRYING INJECTIONS).

Other common headers:
	- Authorization: Bearer XYZ (If you're logged in with a token or somehting then it sends this header to allow you to fetch a particular resource).
	- Referer: google.com (What page/site sent you to this page?)

	- GET - To fetch some data
	- HEAD - Does the same thing as GET, but just shows the response headers.
	- POST - To post some data on to the server
	- PUT - To replace or modify data
	- DELETE - To delete data (May require auth tokens)
	- OPTIONS - To see what are the communication options available to that particular end point (GET,HEAD,POST etc; More like debugging )
