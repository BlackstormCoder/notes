User rate limiting... 
	- Thus you can bypass the bruteforce attempt... If you could find a way to send multiple credentials in 1 request...


For eg. If you could send the request in a JSON format... You could create an array of passwords for that particular username... when the server side tries to check for username and password match... it MAY iterate over a number of passwords attempt to see if anyone of them matches with the username given... Will give you 302 in that request...

	Hence, we can solve this lab, by sending all the passwords in one go... as an array.

		password = [ "hello", "world", "solved the lab"]
