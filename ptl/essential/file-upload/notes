File Upload
=============

You know the drill hack it up.

01:	
	- No filter used.
	- Fun Fact: Retrieved a file shell.php in the web's root directory. Make sure to understand what the code is doing in it.

02:
	- The restriction by the server is that... the file cannot contain .php at the end... So you can use .phtml or .php3 or .php5 extensions as well.
	- Or you can use .pHp or .Php, #will work the same, BUT... Won't execute the same. It will be just a different file extensions.
	- Found another shell.php (different from the previous one... Try to analyse that too)

Summary
========

	- TODO the summary.
