Open Redirect
===============

THE AWESOM-EST-EST SITE OF ALL: https://webhook.site/ Hook any IP here


Open Redirect is a vulnerability to redirect a user(or may be server-bot??) to some other site... Where we can hook it. I don't know how to exploiot it after, yet... But sounds good to me.
01:
	- An awesome challenge, using webhook.site, to get teh key in the user-agent header.

02:
	- This was a tricky one but I get it... If we use //webhook.site/blabla instead of https://webhook.site/blabla. It works absolutely same. Remember that.

Summary
	- TODO the summary.
