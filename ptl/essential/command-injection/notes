Command Injection
==================

Ohh I see how this is different from code execution. Here we inject a command into another command. And there, inject a command within the logic flaw of the code running on the backend.

01:
	- Following command injection tools:
		- &&
		- ||
		- ;
		- |
	- No need to brief the legends.

02:
	- Same challenge as before... This time, just a friendly reminder that you can execute the command as `id` also.
	- I REPEAT... IF THERE IS NO OUTPUT RETURNED THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT DIDN'T EXECUTED... CHECK UP PLZZ.
		- Ohh yea, sleep command does work after all.

03:
	- Btw, you can also run command as $(command). Easy challenge after all.
