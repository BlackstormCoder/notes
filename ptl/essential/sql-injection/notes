SQL injection
===============

You know the drill solve the exercises until you hit a wall.

01:	
	- Use single quotes and the infamous Mysql payload. 
	- Make sure you give space after the comment -- .

02:
	- Potato POTATO, use double quotes this time.

03:
	- The developer has checked the amount of things to retrieve from database. Bypass it by restating the statement to LIMIT 1, and commenting the rest. 

04:
	- This time there is a filter of NO SPACE SHOULD BE USED INSIDE THE FIELDS. This can be bypassed using \t (tab)

	Note: you cannot directly inject \t in the password... It will be interpreted as a string, not as a tab character. Use burp or curl to url-encode the + signs to %09 (the tab in ascii hex)
		- It happened in burp but not when I tried to curl the request. May be the referer header needs to specified.

	- So with the description of next exercise I solved this one... Again.

05:
	- You can also use # in mysql to comment things out... Benefits? No need to specify space after and before use of #.
	- Also, this one has No Space filter too.	
		- The twist here was... You can't use \t either. So I used to following payload all ba mah self

			'or'1'='1'#ezpzlmnsqzy
	Note: The payload won't work if the strings isn't used... Why? Because '(quotes) here are used as a delimiter to differentiate the OR with 1, else it will be read as 'or1'='1'.
	- Alternatively you can use || instead of OR, and then work with integer.
		'||1=1# OR '||1# Would work just fine.

06:
	- addslashes() in php allows you to escape the quotes and other special characters to strings. 
		- In 2006 Chris Shiftlett's Blog gave us a way to bypass addslashes() function i.e. by changing the charset to GBK.
		- GBK is a character set for simplified chinese. The fact that database and database driver don't talk the same charset, we can use %BF to escape any character in our payload to bypass the filter.

	- On second thoughts this issue can be resolved by adding the following sql command.
	- This can turn into a pretty good CTF challenge.
	- Payload used %bf%27||1#
