From SQLi to Shell
====================

Introduction
--------------

Methodology says, "Gaining access to the admin account will give more privileges, and then we can get code execution by uploading a malicious php web shell".

So the steps for the attack will be following:
	- Gather Intel on the web-app and technologies in use.
	- Detection and exploitation of SQL injection
	- Access the admin pages and code execution.

Fingerprinting
===============

Inspecting the headers
-----------------------

	- Can be done via burp... or connecting to the web serving port via telnet or nc.
		- telnet host 80; and send the following payload to retrieve the header:

			GET / HTTP/1.1
			Host: <hostname>

	Note: If the server was using HTTPS only, then telnet or netcat won't work... In that case, use openssl.

		- openssl s_client -connect hostname:443

		Here, no need to send that payload request, things will be automated within openssl command.

Directory Busting
------------------
	
	- You know the drill... Following are good tools to use for this:
		- wfuzz
		- gobuster
		- dirsearch

Introduction to SQL injection
===============================

    - retrieve information using the SELECT statement;
    - update information using the UPDATE statement;
    - add new information using the INSERT statement;
    - delete information using the DELETE statement.
