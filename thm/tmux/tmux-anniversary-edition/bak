prefix + $ = rename session

tmux new -s hello -d = will create a session but by default will detach

Note: To kill all sessions in tmux except for a single one...

	tmux kill-session -t <session-to-be-saved> -a

Note: To use nested tmux it's not a problem, you just have to change the no of times the prefix is pressed...
	prefix, prefix, command will run the command in inner tmux session
	prefix, command will run the command in first tmux session


Check out the room... it's awesome on learning these commands in tmux. If you do things correctly, you can map your brain to handle processes like these.

Note: You have to unset TMUX everytime you create a nested tmux session.

Panes

This wasn't in the room... But if you want you can hold prefix key(mainly the ctrl key) and press o... this will MOVE THE PANE AND CYCLE THROUGH AREAS... 
	- if just pressed and released the prefix key and then pressed o... this can cycle between panes without moving them.

You can also use prefix key and shift } to move the panes anti clockwise (to the up or to the left (if only vertical/horizontal tabs are opened)) 
	- Or the prefix key and shift } to rotate the panes clockwise (to the down or to the right)

Note: the copy/paste mode is prefix key + [ and prefix key + ]


Tmux has default layouts in it... access them with the following command:
	(prefix key) esc [1-5]

	Here 1-5 are the layout options.

To cycle through built in panes you can also press and release the prefix key and then press the spacebar

Note: To list the pane numbers use prefix + q

	tmux prompt > join-pane -t <window(currently opened) to join on another window as pane>

Note: You can use -v flag after the upper commands to HORIZONTALLY JOIN THE PANES or -h to VERTICALLY JOIN THE PANES.

To cycle throught the windows...
	prefix n (next)
	prefix p (prev)

To list all the tmux windows use
