Quick Notes
-------------

Spool service is like console outting in windows

Generally, our victim won't be having access to other network interfaces... but here, this room, had this VM other networks available... To see/manage other interfaces we can use a post module autoroute... 

autoroute is an awesome module... and msf is great... Just that, I need practical experience more.

If get time... Try to read on proxychains, in msf auxiliary/server/socks_proxy


NOTE: auxiliary/server/sock4a is going to deprecate in future... so use... the above proxy... mentioned.
