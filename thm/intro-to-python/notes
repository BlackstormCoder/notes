Intro to Python
-----------------

So as I already know python, I won't be creating much notes in here. Just important key concepts.

Room Covers:
	- Variables
	- Loops
	- Functions
	- Data Structures
	- Libraries and PIP
	- Files

Things Learnt:
	- Functions
		- print()
		- input() (The data passed into input function will by default be a string)
		- type()
		- int()
		- str()
		- float()
		- bool() (If anything passed into this function via input() it will return true (as it will be a string that bool() is trying to convert) so always True until there is no value passed via input)

Note: A function without return statement, returns None

Note: You can put an else statement after for looop, this is a way of implementing your code like this...

	for i in x:
		print(i)

	else:
		print("Done")


Here, after the loop will finish executing, this will add "Done" string to the end of execution of for loop.

File Modes:
	- r
	- w 
	- a
	- a+ (Appending and Read)
	- r+ (Read and write)

File Functions:
	- read() (This will read the whole file at once)
	- readline() (This will read one line each time it is called)
	- readlines() (This will read the whole file, and return a list, elements separated by "\n")
	- write() (This function will write to the end of the file, whatever the string we pass in it)


The Virtual Environment
-------------------------

This is amazing in case I am working on a ctf and I don't want to save my work for later, and want to work in only one time python script. I literally needed something like this.

To later delete your work, just delete the folder from the directory in which you created, your virtualenv.
