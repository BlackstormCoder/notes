This room will discuss the various resource MITRE hasmade available for the cybersecurity community.

- MITRE is not only related to CVEs, they are also related to other areas (even outside of cybersecurity)

- In this room, we will focus on other projects/research that the US-based non-profit MITRE Corporation has created for the cybersecurity community, specifically:

    - ATT&CKÂ® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
    - CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
    - SHIELD (sorry, not a fancy acronym) Active Defense
    - AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)
