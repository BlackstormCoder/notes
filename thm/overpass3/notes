Overpass 3
===========

I would say, I did learn a lot of things... Found a nfs service running on the inside port through some custom script I ran on the box

MAKE SURE TO CHECK INTERNAL PORTS AS WELLL... IT'S HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

SSH PORT FORWARDING WITH NFS MOUNT... DUHHH AWESOME.

ss is alternative to netstat... 

forwarded 3 ports 111 2049 20048, rpc nfs mountd respectively... Don't know why, but this was really a hit all 3 for just a try.

Then there was no root squash enabled... So used privileged mode with -p in bash after cp /bin/bash in the mount directory and assigning it root SUID.

Boom bada boom.

Note: ssh -D flag for using ssh as a proxy... Not sure about it gonna search
