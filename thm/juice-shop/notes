Juice Shop
===========

Juice Shop room is based on Owasp top 10 vulnerabilities
	- Injection
	- Broken Authentication
	- Sensitive Data Exposure
	- Broken Access Control
	- Cross Site Scripting

So above mentioned are the vulnerabilites, that the room will walk us through...

I thought of doing them a day after I complete the respective topic from the OWASP Top 10 room.

Great, so as of 25th Nov, 2020 I have 2 room to tasks, to do here.

Starting with...


Injection
-----------

Well this room taught me email injection... LMAO

So, I don't know why the room is like that, but there are answers already attached to it... May be they want us to just try the practical...

For admin's injection

{
	"email": "' or 1=1 --",
	"password": "a"
} 

For Bender's injection

{
	"email": "bender@juice-sh.op' --"
	"password": "a"
}

Edited in burp.

Broken Authentication
----------------------

Atleast, except for watching which password list to use to bruteforce the admin's password I did pretty all on my own..

Admin's password guess...

Loaded one of the password's list from seclists...

Bruteforced with intruder....


Ok I was wrong I copied that too... But hey, that's the room's fault okay?? That was the whole writeup infront of me... It's so hard to control.

Senstive Data Exposure
------------------------

Tbh, I did that room 2 nights ago... And now, I am here doing it's room.

Ok so I finished the room... Nohing new, "Poison Null Byte". I never heard of it before... And I wonder why so? 

Nvm... I'll dodge and see if I can get time to think about it later.

Broken Access Control
-----------------------

You know what, I will feel free to skip this room by reading the material... I mean I am still manually doing it... Reason behind I will do owasp juice shop fully from my side... create a write-up for that.

So only headings will be up ahead.

XSS
----

All three types were shown here...

Note: XSS when performed using iframes... It is also called as XFS (Cross Frame Attack)
