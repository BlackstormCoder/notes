So, I consider, this room, as one of the most important rooms... I never read through the whole OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, yet...

My plan's gonna be, to do 1 vulnerability from this room everyday, and if you get a chance... Then revise that vulnerability by reading through the official docs, or just research a bit more... Try to practice (if possible). I really kind of want to master these... Before my endterms got over...

TOPICS
============================

	=> INJECTION

	=> BROKEN AUTHENTICATION

	=> SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE

	=> XML EXTERNAL ENTITY (XXE))

	=> BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL

	=> SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION

	=> CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)

	=> INSECURE DESERIALIZATION

	=> COMPONENTS WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES

	=> INSUFFICIENT LOGGING AND MONITORING


Happy Hacking :)
