SQL and OS Injection are different... but the concept is same... i.e. both lead to data exposure... 


SQL - Database Data
Command/OS - System's/User's Data

Prevention:
	- Use of the allow list (filter)
	- Stripping the Input

Active OS Injection - Every response is send to the attcker...

Blind OS Injection - No response is send to the attacker...

passthru() (in PHP) is the major reason behind OS Injection.
