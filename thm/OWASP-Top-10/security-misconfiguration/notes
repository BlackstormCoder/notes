Security Misconfiguration
===========================

- Security Misconfiguration is distinct than other vulnerabilities, as it is found due to bad implementation of configuration, which could have been better. 
	- In simple words, silly mistakes.

Security Misconfigurations include the following:
	- Poorly configured permissions on cloud/hosting services
	- Having unnecesarry features enabled
	- Default accounts with unchanged passwords
	- Detailed error messages that can reveal too much about the system to the attacker.
	- Not using HTTP Security Headers, or revealing too much detail about the server.

- This vulnerability can often lead to more vulnerabilities like: XXE injection, sql injection, RCE, IDOR, Sensitive data leak.

Note: This room, is going to discuss only one type of the security misconfigurations, i.e. Default Passwords.
	- There are others also (listed above), but the focus of the room is only Default Passwords.

Now there are some facts given below of previous data attacks... But that's not important... So I ain't including it here.

IP: 10.10.17.50

- When I put the IP in my browser... it loaded a site with title pensive notes... 

- I did a quick google search on "pensive notes default credentials"...
	- The very first link that popped up was of github repo it was put on... and it gave me the credentials...

Credentials : pensive:PensiveNotes

After I logged into the site... I saw the flag, in the first note from the top.

Flag: thm{4b9513968fd564a87b28aa1f9d672e17}

This was it for this task.
