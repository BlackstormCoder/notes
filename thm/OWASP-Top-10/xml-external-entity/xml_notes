These are notes for programming language... In these notes am gonna talk briefly about how XML works... In order for you to understand any new things in 'notes' file.

- Entities are nothing other than being just variables of XML document, which defines helps us to prevent re-writing and re-using a particular value at multiple places.

- Every XML document starts with a prologue:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Note: This is not compulsory to use, but it's good practice to add prologue in starting.

- The XML document must contain a ROOT element.
	- If an XML document has no ROOT element it would be considered wrong/invalid.

- XML is case-sensitive language.

- Like HTML, we can use attributes in XML too, like this...
	
	<text category="message">blablabla</text>
	Here, category is attribute name and message is attribute's value.
