Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
=====================================

- When web applications are set up, every action performed by a user on the system must be logged
	- This is a great way to know what are the recent changes made to the system.
	- In case, if an attacker makes a move on the system and it leads to data loss, or data breach... Then we can record those actions and take reactions accordingly...

The bigger impacts on the system made by an attacker could include:
	- regulatory damage: If an attacker logged in and steal some user information not only this will affect the user, but also it will affect the owners.
	- risk of further attack: If the attacker logged in and left a root kit inside, and the actions are not logged in then it can lead to n number of future attacks on the web app.

The information stored in logs should include:
	- HTTP status codes
	- Time Stamps
	- Usernames
	- API endpoints/page locations
	- IP addresses

Note: These logs do have some sensitive information on them so its important to ensure that logs are stored securely and multiple copies should be stored in different locations.

Monitoring/Detecting
----------------------

- Logging is more important after a breach or any incident that has occured.
- The aim of detecting suspicious activity is to stop the attacker completely or to reduce the impact they have caused.

- Common examples of suspicious activity include:
	- Multiple Unauthorized attempts for a particular action.
	- Requests from anomalous(something different) IP addresses or location
	- Use of automated tools
		- This can be detected by user-agent headers or the speed of requests
	- Common Payloads
		- It's common for an attacker to try commonly used payloads like "' OR 1=1--" or "<script>alert('1')</script>". Detecting these payloads can identify that someone was conducting an unauthorized/malicious testing on applications.

Note: There are levels of impact in a suspicious activity... For higher impacts, actions need to be taken sooner. Thus they should raise an alarm to the relevant party.

Practical
-----------

Analyze the log file and identify the IP address of attacker.
	49.99.13.16

What kind of attack is being carried out?
	Brute Force

This is it for the whole room. Phew... It was a good journey. 

Peace.
