============

IP: 10.10.157.143

FTP 
	- Anonymous login allowed got the application locally.

RDP

	- I don't know what to do with this one lol
CHATSERVER (9999)

	- And I crashed it by directly running the buffer attack on it so I guess gotta reset the machine...

So, let's go to the windows machine... And then analyze the binary found for buffer overflow... Then, will start the machine again, and then run the exploit on a new instance brainstorm machine. Alright, let's get into hack.
