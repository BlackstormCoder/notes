enum4linux - Whenever SMB comes in play, do not forget this program. This enumerates smb for us... 

Some common flags of enum4linux:
-U             get userlist
-M             get machine list
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
-S             get sharelist
-P             get password policy information
-G             get group and member list

-A             all of the above (full basic enumeration)

smbclient is the way we can login with any credentials found by enum4linux.

- Telnet is just ssh, just less secure and the mode of transmission is over an unencrypted channel and the data can easily be captured.


- FTP has 2 modes... Active and Passive
- FTP has 2 channels... Control and Data 

2 channels so that user don't have to wait for the data to completely transfer before executing further commands.

There are many ftp services like vsftpd, proftpd, in.ftp etc. Every service has it's own vulnerability.
